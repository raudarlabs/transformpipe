 * Where a document's Markdown lives.
 *
 * Postgres keeps what the app queries — name, size, stats, share token, recipients — and those
 * rows stay small no matter how many documents there are. The source itself is a file: it is
 * never filtered on, never sorted by, only fetched whole, and it is the only thing that grows.
 * So it goes to Blob, and the 512 MB ceiling on the database stops being the product's ceiling.
 *
 * The store is private. A source is read here, with the store's token, and its URL never reaches
 * a browser — a shared document is served by our own route, which is where access is decided.
 *
 * Connecting the store to the project hands the function an OIDC identity and a `BLOB_STORE_ID`
 * rather than a long-lived key, so that is the normal path; a read-write token is still honoured
 * where one exists (a script run outside Vercel, say).
 *
 * With neither, the source falls back to the column it used to live in, so a checkout without a
 * store and every row written before it keep working unchanged.
