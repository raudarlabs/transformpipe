/*
 * Client ID Metadata Documents: reading a client's own description off the web.
 *
 * The third way a client can identify itself, beside registering (RFC 7591) and being configured by
 * hand. Its `client_id` is an https URL, the document at that URL says what the client is called
 * and where it may be sent back to, and this server fetches it instead of holding a registration.
 * MCP prefers it, and Claude picks it over registration as soon as an authorization server says it
 * is supported — which is the point: registration mints a fresh client on every connection, and our
 * table already held five rows all called "Claude".
 *
 * draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00, as profiled by the MCP authorization spec of
 * 2025-11-25.
 *
 * This module fetches and checks the shape. What the document is then allowed to mean — which
 * redirect_uris are usable, what a name may contain, how it is stored — is policy and stays in
 * oauth.ts, so there is one place that decides such things for registered and fetched clients
 * alike.
 *
 * The whole of it is a URL taken from a stranger and fetched by our server, which is a server-side
 * request forgery waiting to be written badly. Hence: https only, no redirects followed, the
 * address resolved and refused if it is private, a second timeout, a size cap, and a body that has
 * to be JSON before it is parsed.
