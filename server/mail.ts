/*
 * Outbound email, over Resend's HTTP API.
 *
 * One `fetch` rather than the SDK. The SDK is a dependency, a build-time weight and a version to
 * keep current, and what it wraps is a single POST with a bearer token — the same argument that
 * keeps the CLI dependency-free.
 *
 * Everything here is best effort. A share that succeeded must not be reported as failed because a
 * mail provider was slow, and a deployment with no key configured must behave like a deployment
 * that simply does not send mail — silently, not by throwing on the first share. So every function
 * returns what happened and nothing here ever rejects.
 *
 * And every caller AWAITS it. The first version fired these off after the response and moved on,
 * which is the natural thing to write and the wrong thing in a serverless function: the platform
 * may freeze the instance the moment the response is sent, and a fetch that had not left yet never
 * does. Three addresses were added on a live deployment and Resend logged nothing at all — not a
 * failure, an absence. So the send is part of the request, and `TIMEOUT_MS` is what keeps a slow
 * provider from turning that into a slow share.
 *
 * In English, whatever the sender's language. These messages go to somebody who has never been to
 * the site, at an address we know nothing else about: there is no locale to read, and the shared
 * document page they are about to open is English for the same reason.
 *
 * Deliverability is mostly not in this file. SPF and DKIM are Resend's records and verified; the
 * missing piece when the first notice landed in spam was a DMARC record on the domain, which is
 * DNS rather than code. What is in here is not making it worse: a subject that does not lead with
 * a raw address, a Reply-To when there is a person behind the message, and both MIME parts.
