/*
 * TransformPipe as an OAuth 2.1 authorization server, for one resource: the MCP endpoint.
 *
 * It has to be its own server. The MCP authorization spec forbids a resource accepting a token
 * issued by anybody else, so the Neon Auth session cannot be handed to a client — the person signs
 * in here exactly as they always do, approves a named client on a page they looked at, and the
 * client walks away with a token of ours that acts as them and reaches nothing else.
 *
 * The order of events, which is not obvious from any one file:
 *
 *   1. The client POSTs /api/mcp with no token and gets 401 plus a WWW-Authenticate header naming
 *      the protected-resource document.
 *   2. It reads /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource (RFC 9728) to find the authorization server,
 *      then /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server (RFC 8414) to find these endpoints.
 *   3. It identifies itself: either its client_id is an https URL and we fetch the metadata
 *      document there (`server/cimd.ts`), or it registers here (RFC 7591) and is given one. No
 *      secret either way — a client running on someone else's machine cannot keep one, which is
 *      what PKCE is for.
 *   4. It sends the person to /authorize with a PKCE challenge. Not signed in, they are parked and
 *      bounced through the app's own sign-in.
 *   5. They approve — a POST from a page they read, so a link on its own authorises nothing.
 *   6. The client exchanges the code and its verifier at /token for an access and a refresh token.
