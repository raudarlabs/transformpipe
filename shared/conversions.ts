/*
 * The conversions this app offers: one list of what they are, and no word of any language.
 *
 * There is still only one list, and everything that needs to know which conversions exist reads
 * it: the menu in the header, the screen each conversion gets, the chips in the history, the badge
 * on a row, the API's `from` parameter, and the prerenderer that gives each one a real page a
 * stranger can arrive on. A second list would mean a menu offering a conversion the dropzone will
 * not accept, which is the kind of thing nobody notices until a person tries it.
 *
 * What each one is *called* is no longer here. It could not stay: the server imports this file for
 * the API's `kind` parameter, and the server has no locale — a list it reads cannot carry a
 * language without picking one for every reader at once. So the split is by what a thing is, not
 * by who reads it. An id, a target, an address and a file extension are the same in German as in
 * English and stay; the label, the heading, the blurb, the dropzone hint and the search-result text
 * moved to `src/lib/i18n/messages/<locale>/conversions.ts`, keyed by the same `ConversionId`, where
 * they are written once per language.
 *
 * Every conversion normalises to Markdown or to HTML from Markdown, because Markdown is what a
 * document is stored as — the rendering, the sharing, the API and the assistant tools all stand on
 * that one shape, and a second stored form would be a second version of all of it.
