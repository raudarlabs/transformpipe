Nobody searches for a Pandoc alternative because Pandoc is bad. ([What Pandoc actually is](/blog/what-is-pandoc), if that is the question underneath.) They search because they wanted an HTML file and found themselves reading about template variables, or because the PDF flag asked for a TeX distribution, or because there is no terminal on the machine where the document lives. The tool is not the problem. The distance between the tool and the job is.

### TL;DR

Pandoc is the right answer whenever anything other than HTML comes out of the pipeline — DOCX, EPUB, LaTeX, a typeset PDF, a bibliography — and nothing else on this page comes close on that. If HTML is the only output, the alternative you want depends on the reason you are looking: **a browser converter** if you want no install and one finished file, **marked or markdown-it** if the conversion happens inside code you already run, **a hosted API or a GitHub Action** if it happens in CI and you do not want a package step in the runner, **a static site generator** if the answer is a site rather than a document. The honest part is at the bottom: four jobs where every substitute here fails and you should install Pandoc instead.

## The friction, named precisely

Converting Markdown to HTML with Pandoc is one line. That is not where the cost is.

The cost is the second line. A bare `pandoc -t html` returns a fragment — headings and paragraphs with no doctype, no `<head>`, nothing a browser will treat as a page. `--standalone` fixes that by wrapping your content in Pandoc's default template, which is deliberately plain, and the moment you want it to look like anything you are into `--css` for a stylesheet, `-V` for template variables, or `--template` with a file written in Pandoc's own template language: `$body$`, `$for(author)$`, `$if(toc)$`. No other tool reads that file. It is now part of your build, and somebody has to maintain it.

Then there is the stylesheet problem. `--css` leaves you with an HTML file that needs a second file beside it, which is exactly wrong if the plan was to email the page to a colleague. Pandoc can inline assets instead, but the flag that does it was renamed between major releases, so check `pandoc --help` rather than a forum answer from four years ago.

None of this is difficult. It is a real amount of setup for one page, and the amount does not shrink when the job is small. That asymmetry is the entire reason this article exists.

## What Pandoc is unmatched at

Be fair to it first, because the fair account is also the useful one — it tells you when to stop reading.

Pandoc reads a document into an internal representation and writes that representation back out in another format. The indirection is the trick: nobody had to write a Markdown-to-DOCX converter, because every reader can feed every writer. That single design decision is why the format list runs to dozens of entries, and why no smaller tool has ever caught up.

**A format matrix.** One source file, several outputs, kept in step. HTML for the site, DOCX for the reviewer who redlines in Word, EPUB for the reader on a train. Every alternative below does one output well. Pandoc does the matrix.

**Academic writing.** Maths, cross-references, numbered figures, and `--citeproc` with a BibTeX file and a CSL style, so the bibliography formats itself in whatever house style the journal demands. Nothing else in this article has a citation processor at all.

**Word output in a house style.** `--reference-doc` takes fonts, heading styles and spacing from an existing `.docx` and applies them to yours. If a template arrived from a legal or marketing team, that flag is the whole reason to install Pandoc.

**Filters.** A Lua or JSON filter rewrites the document while it is still a tree — renumber every table, strip a section, rewrite every internal link, promote every heading by one level. Doing the same thing with a regular expression over the finished HTML works right up until it does not.

```bash
pandoc -f gfm -t docx notes.md -o notes.docx
pandoc -f gfm -t epub book.md -o book.epub
pandoc -f gfm --citeproc --bibliography=refs.bib paper.md -o paper.pdf
```

The third line carries a caveat worth knowing before you type it. Markdown to PDF is not one of Pandoc's writers. Pandoc makes a PDF by handing the document to a separate engine, and the default is a TeX engine, so that pipeline usually means installing a TeX distribution too — a much larger install than Pandoc itself, and the most common reason somebody decides Pandoc is more than they wanted. `--pdf-engine` can point at an HTML- or Typst-based engine instead, which is far smaller and handles maths and page layout differently.

## Quick comparison: the cheat sheet

| Tool | Best for | Key capability | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## The alternatives, by the reason you are looking

Each section below answers a different sentence. Find yours and skip the rest. If you want the wider field rather than the Pandoc-shaped question, [the full converter comparison](/blog/best-markdown-to-html-converters) covers the same tools with different weightings.

### Pandoc itself — the baseline you are measuring against

Worth one section of its own, because half the people looking for an alternative are really looking for permission to keep using this.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Converts between formats nothing else touches | A binary to install, and a terminal to type in |
| `--standalone` produces a whole document, not a fragment | Templates are a language only Pandoc reads |
| Filters rewrite the document as a tree | PDF output needs a separate engine, often TeX |
| `--sandbox` restricts filesystem access for untrusted input | Raw HTML passes straight through: no sanitising |

**Price:** free, GPL licensed.

**Technical details and features**

- Written in Haskell, distributed as a single binary for the major platforms
- Its own extended dialect by default, with CommonMark and GFM readers selected by flag
- `--standalone` for a full document; a separate flag inlines images and CSS
- `--citeproc`, `--bibliography` and CSL styles for references
- Lua and JSON filters for rewriting the abstract syntax tree mid-conversion

**Who should use it?** Anybody whose document has to become something other than a web page, now or within the next few months. The template language is a fair price for the format matrix. It is a poor price for one README.

### TransformPipe — no install, and one file that opens anywhere

A browser converter suits a document that is not part of a build at all. You open a page, drop the `.md` file on it, and download HTML. It is worth knowing [which online converters upload your file and which do not](/blog/best-online-document-converters) before you pick one. Signed out, nothing is uploaded: the file is read, parsed and rendered on your own machine, which you can confirm by watching the network tab do nothing while it works.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Nothing to install, and no terminal | One document at a time, or several chained into one — not a site |
| The export is one self-contained file with styles inline | No template language, so layouts are the ones on offer |
| Signed out, the file never leaves the machine | The browser does the work, so a very large file is limited by the machine |
| Sanitises against one allow-list, in the browser and on the server alike | Nothing outside HTML: no DOCX, no EPUB, no typeset PDF |

**Price:** free. Signing up adds conversion history, share links and API keys, and costs nothing either.

**Technical details and features**

- Reads GitHub Flavored Markdown, so tables, task lists, strikethrough and fenced code survive
- What downloads is a whole page: a doctype, a `<head>`, the CSS inside a `<style>` block, and not one external request
- Any raw HTML in the source is filtered against a fixed allow-list on the way through
- Saves as `.html`, `.md` or plain text; a PDF comes out of the browser's print dialog rather than a TeX engine
- Also converts HTML, Word, CSV/TSV and JSON back to Markdown
- The same converter is reachable four other ways: a REST API, a CLI, a GitHub Action and an MCP server

**Who should use it?** Anybody whose next step is "send this to a person", and anybody on a machine where installing a binary is somebody else's decision. This is the closest substitute for `pandoc --standalone --embed-resources`, without the install and without the template.

### Dillinger and StackEdit — when you are still writing the thing

Both are browser Markdown editors with export, and both are the right answer to a different question: not "convert this file" but "write this document and get HTML at the end". Dillinger exports HTML and PDF and syncs to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive and GitHub. StackEdit keeps working without a connection once it has loaded, and publishes to several destinations when it has one.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Write and export without leaving the browser | Editor-first: neither is built for converting files you already have |
| Cloud sync to the usual places | The document goes through a hosted service |
| Free and open source | Export styling is the tool's, not yours |
| StackEdit works offline once loaded | StackEdit's extended syntax can travel badly to other parsers |

**Price:** free. Dillinger is MIT licensed; StackEdit is Apache 2.0 licensed.

**Technical details and features**

- Live preview beside the source, with the usual editor conveniences
- Export to HTML and PDF from the browser, no local install
- Sync and publish targets including Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive and GitHub
- Documents live in browser storage or in the connected account, not on your filesystem by default

**Who should use it?** People composing now rather than converting later. If the file already exists on disk and you only want HTML out of it, a converter is a shorter path than an editor.

### Typora — a desktop application instead of a command

The no-terminal answer for somebody who writes Markdown every day. Typora replaces the syntax with its rendering as you type, keeps the files on your own disk, and exports HTML, PDF and Word from a menu.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Comfortable to write in for hours | Paid, and desktop only |
| Exports HTML, PDF and Word with themes | Not a batch tool and not a build step |
| Files stay on your machine | WYSIWYG hides the syntax, which some writers dislike |

**Price:** $14.99 without tax, a one-time purchase covering up to three devices, with a 15-day free trial (checked on typora.io, 8 September 2026).

**Technical details and features**

- WYSIWYG editing over plain `.md` files on the local filesystem
- Export to HTML, PDF, Word and several other formats through the application menu
- Themes are CSS, so export styling is editable without a template language
- Handles tables, footnotes, maths and diagrams as editor features

**Who should use it?** Anybody who writes Markdown daily and wants an application rather than a command. It covers Pandoc's HTML, PDF and Word outputs for one document at a time, with a mouse, and it covers none of them in a script.

### Obsidian — exporting from the notes you already keep

Not a converter, but frequently the reason somebody does not need one: the document is already in a vault of local Markdown files, and the export is a menu item away. PDF export ships with the application. HTML export comes from community plugins, which is a real distinction — the core product does not promise it.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Local files, no upload, works offline | HTML export depends on a community plugin, not the core app |
| PDF export built in | Wiki links and embeds are Obsidian syntax, not GFM |
| Free for personal and commercial use | Not a pipeline: exports happen when a person clicks |

**Price:** free for all purposes, including commercial use; optional commercial licences are sold annually (checked on obsidian.md, 8 September 2026).

**Technical details and features**

- Vaults are ordinary directories of `.md` files, so any other tool can read them too
- `[[wiki links]]`, embeds and callouts are extensions: check what your target parser does with them
- Plugin ecosystem covers export, publishing and site generation
- Nothing leaves the machine unless you enable a sync or publish service

**Who should use it?** People whose Markdown already lives in a vault. The warning is the syntax: a note full of `[[wiki links]]` converted by a strict GFM parser produces literal double brackets in the output, because those brackets are not Markdown.

### VS Code — the shortest path if the file is already open

The preview pane in VS Code is markdown-it underneath, and export arrives through extensions rather than the editor itself. For a README already open in a tab, that beats installing anything.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Already installed, for most developers | Export needs an extension, and extensions vary in quality |
| Preview behaviour matches markdown-it's CommonMark handling | Preview styling is not the exported styling |
| Extensions cover HTML, PDF and slides | Converts what is open: not a batch, not a build |

**Price:** free.

**Technical details and features**

- Built-in preview rendered by markdown-it, with GFM features enabled for the preview
- Export extensions wrap the fragment in a document and inline or link a stylesheet — which one, depends on the extension
- Workspace settings can add a custom preview stylesheet
- Nothing is uploaded; conversion happens in the editor process

**Who should use it?** Developers who need the file currently in the editor and nothing beyond it. Check what the extension puts around the fragment before you send the result to anybody, because "it looked right in the preview" is not the same claim as "it opens right on somebody else's laptop".

### marked and markdown-it — the JavaScript route

If the conversion belongs inside code you already run, a library is smaller than a binary and easier to reason about. marked is small and fast with GFM on by default. markdown-it is CommonMark-compliant, has a structured plugin system, and escapes raw HTML unless you tell it otherwise — which is the safer default of the two.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| One dependency, no separate install to document | Both return a fragment: the wrapper is your job |
| The HTML around the output is HTML you wrote, not a template you inherited | No format matrix — HTML only |
| markdown-it escapes raw HTML by default | Plugin quality varies across the ecosystem |
| Runs in Node and in the browser alike | Syntax highlighting and sanitising are separate decisions |

**Price:** free, both MIT licensed.

**Technical details and features**

- marked: GFM by default, custom renderers per node type, a lexer you can call for tokens instead of HTML
- markdown-it: passes the CommonMark suite, `html: false` by default, rules addable and reorderable
- Neither sanitises for you; the documented answer is a dedicated sanitiser over the output
- Both are the engine inside larger tools, so bug reports and edge cases are well travelled

**Who should use it?** Any project that already has a Node build. [The full JavaScript comparison](/blog/markdown-to-html-in-javascript) goes through the differences properly, and [converting from a terminal](/blog/markdown-to-html-from-the-command-line) has the wrapper script in full — about fifteen lines, which is the honest measure of what Pandoc's `--standalone` is worth to you.

### remark and rehype — when you need to change the document

The unified ecosystem parses Markdown to an AST, lets you rewrite it, then renders. It is the only alternative here that competes with Pandoc's Lua filters, and it competes well.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| A real syntax tree you can walk, query and rewrite | The heaviest option on this page |
| rehype-sanitize is a pipeline step, not an afterthought | The pipeline takes genuine learning |
| Plugins for GFM, front matter, headings, links | Overkill for turning one file into one page |
| Powers MDX and Docusaurus, so it is well exercised | Still HTML-only at the end |

**Price:** free, MIT licensed.

**Technical details and features**

- Two tree formats — mdast for Markdown, hast for HTML — and a plugin to convert one into the other
- remark-gfm for tables and task lists; remark-frontmatter for the YAML header
- The same trees are used to build linters, formatters and codemods over prose
- Sanitising happens on the tree, before HTML exists, which is stricter than filtering strings

**Who should use it?** Teams that have to alter the document in transit: rewriting every relative link, pulling headings out for navigation, enforcing a house style. If you were reaching for a Lua filter, this is the substitute.

### Python-Markdown, markdown-it-py and mistune — the Python route

The same logic in a different language. Python-Markdown is the mature option with a large extension catalogue and is the engine under MkDocs. markdown-it-py is a port of markdown-it, so it brings CommonMark conformance and the same plugin shape. mistune is the fast one.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Natural fit if the build is already Python | Fragment output in all three cases |
| Python-Markdown's extension API is well documented and widely used | Python-Markdown is not CommonMark-compliant in every detail |
| markdown-it-py gives you spec conformance and a familiar plugin model | Three libraries means three sets of edge cases |
| mistune is quick enough for large batches | Highlighting and sanitising are still yours to arrange |

**Price:** free. Python-Markdown is BSD licensed, markdown-it-py is MIT licensed, mistune is BSD licensed.

**Technical details and features**

- Python-Markdown: official extensions for tables, footnotes, attribute lists and table of contents
- markdown-it-py: a port of the JavaScript parser, used where CommonMark behaviour must match
- mistune: pure Python with a plugin system, no compiled dependency
- All three hand back a string, so the document wrapper is a template in your own code

**Who should use it?** Python projects, documentation builds and anything already importing from PyPI. Test one document with a table in it first: the three libraries disagree about tables, because tables are an extension in all of them rather than core syntax.

### cmark-gfm — the small binary inside a build

GitHub's fork of the CommonMark reference implementation, written in C, with the GFM extensions added. It is quick, it has no runtime to install alongside it, and it hands you a fragment with no styling and no wrapper.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Tiny and fast, with no language runtime required | Fragment only: nothing resembling `--standalone` |
| Implements the GFM extensions, tables included | Extensions are what is in the box and no more |
| Sensible inside a Makefile or a container image | You compile it or find a package for your platform |

**Price:** free, open source — cmark is BSD licensed, and GitHub's cmark-gfm fork carries its own notice.

**Technical details and features**

- CommonMark plus the GFM extensions: tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks, footnotes as an option
- A C library as well as a command line binary, so it embeds in other programmes
- Flags control raw HTML handling, which matters for untrusted input
- No templating, no CSS, no asset embedding — by design

**Who should use it?** Builds that already supply their own layout and only need the body. It is the closest thing to Pandoc's speed and single-binary convenience, with none of its range.

### A hosted API, a CLI or a GitHub Action — CI without a package step

The CI case is its own problem. Installing Pandoc in a runner is a step that downloads a binary on every job, and TeX in a runner is worse. The alternatives are a request to an API, a dependency-free CLI, or a workflow step that does the conversion for you.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Nothing installed in the runner, so nothing to cache or pin | An API means the document leaves the machine |
| One workflow step, and the same conversion as the web page | A key in repository secrets to create and rotate |
| Output is a complete self-contained file, ready to publish | HTML only: a release that needs a PDF still needs an engine |
| The CLI has no dependency tree to audit | A hosted service is a dependency you do not control |

**Price:** free tier; an account is required to issue API keys.

**Technical details and features**

- REST endpoint taking Markdown and returning a complete HTML document
- A CLI with no dependencies, for a runner that has a shell and nothing else
- A GitHub Action for converting on push, on merge or on a release tag
- An MCP server, for the case where the thing doing the converting is a model rather than a person

**Who should use it?** Anybody rebuilding a page on every commit. [Publishing from a workflow](/blog/publish-markdown-from-github-actions) walks through the pull request version, where the output is attached to the PR rather than deployed. The privacy trade is real and worth stating plainly: a browser conversion keeps the file local, and an API call does not.

### Pandoc in Docker — skipping the install, keeping the matrix

*Pandoc without installing* usually means one of two things. The first is a web front end running Pandoc on somebody else's server, which is fine for a public README and wrong for a draft contract. The second is the official container image, which keeps your machine clean and keeps every format.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/data" pandoc/core -f gfm -t html -s README.md -o README.html
```

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| The whole format matrix, nothing installed on the host | You have installed Docker instead, which is larger |
| Reproducible: the image pins the version for everybody | Mounted volumes and file permissions become your problem |
| Variant images exist for the heavier LaTeX pipelines | Slower per run than a local binary |

**Price:** free, GPL licensed.

**Who should use it?** Teams who want one pinned Pandoc across several machines, and anybody on a locked-down laptop that has Docker but no package manager. It is the honest middle: you skip the install without handing your document to a stranger.

### Static site generators — the answer when you wanted a site

Hugo, Eleventy, MkDocs, Docusaurus and Jekyll all turn Markdown into HTML, and not one of them is a converter in the sense this page means. Each is a build system. It wants a directory, a configuration file, a set of templates and a deploy target; in exchange it hands back navigation, search, feeds and cross-links across every page at once.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Navigation and templating across many documents | Far too much machinery for a single file |
| Quick builds, thorough documentation, deployed everywhere | A configuration file and a build step to keep alive forever |
| Themes, plugins and a deployment story | The output is a directory of pages, not a file you can email |

**Price:** free. Hugo is Apache 2.0 licensed; Eleventy, Docusaurus and Jekyll are MIT licensed; MkDocs is BSD licensed.

**Technical details and features**

- Each ships a Markdown engine: Goldmark in Hugo, markdown-it in Eleventy by default, Python-Markdown in MkDocs
- Front matter drives titles, dates, tags and navigation order
- Output is a directory tree of HTML with shared assets, meant to be served
- Deployment is part of the model: a build command and a host

**Who should use it?** Anybody whose output is a set of pages that reference one another. One file and one recipient is the wrong shape for a generator entirely — that job wants a document, not a website.

### GitHub's Markdown API — GFM rendered exactly as GitHub renders it

An HTTP endpoint that takes Markdown and returns HTML. It is the only way to get GitHub's own rendering without screen-scraping a page, and the output is a fragment wrapped in nothing.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Byte-for-byte GitHub Flavored Markdown behaviour | The document is uploaded to GitHub to be rendered |
| No install at all: one HTTP request | Rate limited, and authentication is required to raise the limit |
| Useful for verifying what GFM really does | Fragment output, with GitHub's class names on some elements |

**Price:** free, rate limited.

**Who should use it?** Anybody who has to match GitHub's rendering precisely, and nobody who needs a finished page. Treat it as a reference implementation you can call, not as an export route.

## The jobs that genuinely require Pandoc

This is the section a comparison page usually leaves out, so here it is with the hedging removed. Four jobs should not be attempted with anything above.

**Anything with a bibliography.** If the document cites sources and the citations have to be formatted to a style, `--citeproc` with a BibTeX file and a CSL style is the tool. There is no substitute on this page. Doing it by hand means maintaining a reference list that goes stale the first time a co-author reorders a section.

**A typeset PDF with real page layout.** Widows, orphans, figure placement, page numbers, cross-references that say "see page 14". Browser print-to-PDF gets you a readable document and not a typeset one, because the browser is laying out a web page and then cutting it into pages. If the output has to look composed, Pandoc handing off to a TeX or Typst engine is the route, and the extra install is the price.

**DOCX in somebody else's template.** When a `.docx` template arrives with mandated fonts, heading styles and spacing, `--reference-doc` applies it. No Markdown-to-Word converter that skips this step will produce a file the template's owner accepts, and reformatting by hand in Word is a job you will do again next quarter.

**EPUB, LaTeX, reStructuredText, MediaWiki, Org and the rest of the matrix.** The moment two of those appear in the same requirement, the argument is over. Chaining single-purpose tools to fake a matrix means every format is one tool's edge cases away from breaking, and the breakages arrive separately.

There is one thing Pandoc deliberately does not do, and it cuts the other way: it does not sanitise. Raw HTML in a Markdown file passes straight through to the output, `<script>` tags included, because faithful conversion is the job it signed up for. `--sandbox` restricts filesystem access during conversion, which is a different protection. If the file came from outside — a client, a repository, a form submission — you need a sanitising step of your own, and [why that has to happen in more than one place](/blog/sanitising-markdown-safely) is worth ten minutes before you open the result in a browser.

## How to choose

1. **Write down every output format this document must produce over its life.** If DOCX, EPUB, LaTeX or a typeset PDF appears on that list, install Pandoc and stop comparing; every hour spent on a substitute is an hour spent on a tool you will replace.
2. **Decide whether the destination is a person or a server.** A person needs one self-contained file that opens with the network off. A server needs a fragment your templates will wrap. Picking the wrong one produces either unstyled text in somebody's inbox or a document with two copies of the page furniture.
3. **Count the installs the job can bear.** A one-off conversion should not require a package manager; a nightly build should not require a browser tab and a human in it. Both mistakes are common and both are obvious in hindsight.
4. **Check where the file goes before you convert it.** Browser-side conversion keeps the document on your machine and you can verify that from the network tab. An API, a hosted editor and GitHub's Markdown endpoint all mean the document travels, which is irrelevant for a public README and decisive for a contract.
5. **Convert one representative file and open the result somewhere else.** Not in the tool's preview — a different browser, a different machine, no connection. That single test catches fragments, missing stylesheets, CDN font links and lost tables at once, and it takes about a minute.

## Conclusion

The reason "Pandoc alternative" is such a common search is that Pandoc answers a bigger question than most people are asking, and answering a bigger question always costs more. If the document has to become a Word file, an EPUB or a typeset PDF, install Pandoc and learn its templates — it will outlast every other tool named here. If HTML is the only output, pick by the reason you came: a library where the build already lives, a workflow step where CI already runs, a generator when the answer is a site, and a browser converter when what you want is one finished file with nobody's install standing in the way — which is what [TransformPipe's Markdown to HTML conversion](/) does, free, in your own browser, with nothing uploaded when you are signed out.

## FAQ

### What is the best Pandoc alternative for Markdown to HTML?

There is no single one, because Pandoc covers several jobs at once. For one finished page with no install, a browser converter that produces self-contained HTML; for conversion inside code, marked or markdown-it; for CI, an API or a GitHub Action; for a whole site, a static site generator. Each replaces one part of what Pandoc does, and none replaces the format matrix.

### Can I use Pandoc without installing it?

Yes, in two ways with different trade-offs. The official Docker image runs the real Pandoc with nothing installed on the host except Docker, which keeps your document local. A hosted web front end also runs Pandoc, but on somebody else's machine, so the file is uploaded — fine for a public README, wrong for anything confidential.

### Is Pandoc overkill for converting one Markdown file to HTML?

Usually, yes. A bare conversion returns a fragment, so you need `--standalone`, and making that output look like anything means a stylesheet flag, template variables or a template file in Pandoc's own language. For one page that somebody has to read, a converter that hands back a complete self-contained document skips all of it.

### Why does my Pandoc HTML have no styling?

Because you did not pass `--standalone`, or you did and got the default template, which is intentionally plain. Add a stylesheet with `--css` and you now have two files that must travel together; inline the assets instead if the file has to open on its own. That gap between "converted" and "presentable" is the most common reason people start looking for an alternative.

### What replaces Pandoc's Lua filters?

remark and the unified ecosystem, more closely than anything else. Both parse the document into a syntax tree you can rewrite before rendering, which is the same shape of solution — rewrite the tree, not the output string. The difference is that Pandoc's tree spans every format it supports, while remark's covers Markdown and HTML.

### Do the alternatives handle tables and task lists?

Only if they implement GitHub Flavored Markdown, because tables and task lists are not in the CommonMark specification. marked, cmark-gfm and GFM-configured markdown-it do; a strict CommonMark parser renders your table as a paragraph full of pipe characters and reports no error at all. Convert one file with a table in it before you commit to any tool on this page.

### Is a browser converter safe for a confidential document?

It depends entirely on whether the conversion happens in the browser or on a server, and those look identical from the outside. A browser-side converter reads the file with the File API and never sends it, which you can verify by opening the network tab and watching nothing happen. Anything that shows you a progress bar while a server works has your document.
