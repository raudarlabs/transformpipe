 * title, description, date, tag, keywords, reading time — and is in the main bundle because the
 * front page and the index both show it. The prose is not: an eager glob put all of it there too,

 * the converter and never touched the blog. Each body is its own chunk now, fetched when somebody
 * opens that article.
