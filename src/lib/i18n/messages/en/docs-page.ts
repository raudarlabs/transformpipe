/*
 * The manual's own prose — every word the /docs page says in its own right.
 *
 * Its own file rather than a corner of `ui.ts` because it is by far the largest single screen in
 * the product: some 1,700 words in seventy-five entries, more than the rest of the interface put
 * together, which in `ui.ts` would bury every other screen. It is spread into `ui` in `index.ts`
 * all the same, so `useT()` reaches these keys like any other interface string and the key set
 * stays one flat table for `scripts/check-i18n.mjs` to compare.
 *
 * Keys follow the convention in `index.ts` — `docs.<section>.<thing>`, where `<section>` is the id
 * of the section the sentence sits in, so a key says where on the page it appears and rewording it
 * never means renaming the key.
 *
 * A sentence that wraps a piece of code, a bold label or an emphasised word is ONE entry with a
 * `{placeholder}` where the element goes, never three fragments. Fragments cannot be reordered: a
 * German sentence puts the header name, the verb and the path in a different order than English
 * does, and three separate strings would force it into English word order. The elements themselves
 * — the paths, flags, headers, extensions and endpoints — stay in the page's JSX, because none of
 * them is a word anybody translates.
 *
 * What is NOT here: the eleven section titles, which are `docs` in this same directory — the
 * page's headings and its contents list read the one entry there, so a heading and the line that
 * links to it cannot say two different things. Nor the questions at the foot of the page (`faq`),
 * nor the MCP tool descriptions in `src/lib/mcp-facts.ts` — the connector answers in English and
 * its tool names and descriptions are part of a protocol, not prose.
