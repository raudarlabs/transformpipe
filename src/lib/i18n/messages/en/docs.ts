/*
 * The documentation's sections in English: a title and the one sentence that says what the section
 * answers, keyed by the section's id.
 *
 * The ids and the order live in `src/lib/docs-sections.ts`, because an id is the anchor in the
 * address — `/docs#converting` — and an address is the same in every language. Every id in that
 * list needs a key here, and in every other locale.
 *
 * The summary is read on its own in the prerendered page, so it has to stand up without the
 * section under it.
