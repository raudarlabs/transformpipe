 * always the one being read.
 *
 * The words are not here any more. A question and its answer are language, so they sit in the
 * catalogue — `i18n/messages/en/faq.ts` for English, the same array in the same order for every
 * other locale. What is left in this file is the part that is the same in every language: how many
 * questions there are, what order they are asked in, and where each one belongs.
