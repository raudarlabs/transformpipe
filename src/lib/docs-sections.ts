 * crawler receives from it — otherwise /docs ships as a title and a sentence, and the ten sections
 * that make it worth reading exist only after the bundle has run.
 *
 * The wording is not here any more: a title and a summary are language, so they live in the
 * catalogue under the section's id — `i18n/messages/en/docs.ts` for English, the same keys for
 * every other locale. What stays is the part no translation may touch: which sections exist, in
 * what order, and under which id. The id is the anchor in the address a reader can link to and the
 * key the icons on the page are chosen by, so it is the same word in every language.
