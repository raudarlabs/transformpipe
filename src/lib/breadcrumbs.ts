/*
 * The trail for every page, in one place.
 *
 * Two things read it and they must not disagree: the app, which draws it, and the prerenderer,
 * which emits it as `BreadcrumbList` structured data for a search result to show instead of a bare
 * URL. A trail that says one thing to a reader and another to a crawler is worse than none, because
 * the mismatch is the kind of thing that gets structured data ignored site-wide.
 *
 * Every function here takes the catalogue and the locale rather than reading them from a hook,
 * because the prerenderer has no hooks: it builds five languages of every page in one Node process,
 * so the words and the language have to be arguments. The app passes what `useI18n()` gave it.
