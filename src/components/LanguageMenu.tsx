/*
 * The language switcher.
 *
 * Each language is named in itself — Deutsch, not German — because the name a reader recognises is
 * the one in their own language, and a reader who has landed on the wrong one cannot read the list
 * that would get them out of it.
 *
 * Beside each name, its flag — and the name stays, because a flag is a country and a language is
 * not: German is spoken in three of them and Spanish across two continents. The flag makes an
 * entry findable at a glance; the name is what actually says which language it is. `LocaleFlag`
 * explains why they are drawn as SVG rather than written as emoji.
 *
 * Switching is a navigation, not a state change. `setLocale` rewrites the address to the same page
 * in the new language, so the choice is in the URL where it can be shared, reloaded and indexed —
 * and it is remembered, so the automatic choice never argues with a reader who has made one.
