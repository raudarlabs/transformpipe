/*
 * A flag per language, drawn rather than typed.
 *
 * Not emoji. A regional-indicator pair is the obvious way to write 🇩🇪 and Windows does not render
 * it as a flag at all — it shows the two letters in a box — so the switcher would look broken on
 * the platform most of these readers are on. Four flat rectangles of SVG render identically
 * everywhere and weigh nothing.
 *
 * A flag is a country and a language is not: German is spoken in Austria and Switzerland, French
 * in Belgium and Quebec, Spanish across two continents. The mark beside a language name is a
 * shorthand for that language's own name, which is why the name is always there next to it in the
 * menu — the flag alone would be making a claim about a country nobody asked it to make.
 *
 * `en` is the Union Jack because this product writes British English, which is also what `Intl`
 * gets told (see `INTL_LOCALES`): "8 September 2026", not "September 8, 2026".

/*
 * 4:3, so all five sit on the same box whatever their real proportions are — and a hairline round
 * that box, in the border colour, because a box is only the same size if it can be seen to be. On
 * the dark theme Germany's black stripe vanished into the page and its flag read a third shorter
 * than the rest; on the light one the white of France and Italy did the same at the edges.
