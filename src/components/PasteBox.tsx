/*
 * The other way in: text from the clipboard rather than a file from the disk.
 *
 * Everything here used to need a file, which is an awkward thing to ask of somebody who has the
 * Markdown in their clipboard and no reason to save it first. The text is handed to the same
 * `onFiles` the dropzone calls — synthesised into a file with this conversion's own extension — so
 * the conversion, the size limit, the preview, the download, the save and the history are the ones
 * that already work rather than a second path that looks the same and drifts.
 *
 * Closed by default. An open textarea under the dropzone makes the front page read as two things
 * competing for the same job; the button says the other way exists and gets out of the way.
 *
 * A binary source (Word, Notion, Confluence, Obsidian, Excel) has no text to paste at all — but the
 * screen still renders this component, disabled rather than left out, so the row this button sits
 * on is the same height on every conversion's page. Leaving it out entirely used to mean the
 * conversion picker jumped up to fill the gap every time somebody switched to one of these.
