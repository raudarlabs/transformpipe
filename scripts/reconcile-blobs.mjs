/* Finds where the store and the database disagree.

 *   node scripts/reconcile-blobs.mjs --write   delete the orphaned files
 *
 * Two things can drift, and they are not equally bad:
 *
 *   orphaned file    a blob with no row — a create that failed after the upload, or a delete that
 *                    removed the row and then could not reach the store. Costs storage, nothing
 *                    else. Safe to remove.
 *   missing source   a row whose blob is gone. That is a document that cannot be opened, and it is
 *                    reported but never "fixed" here: only its owner can decide what to do.
